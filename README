Enter "x<tab>" followed by a search term to begin using Switch to Tab. You can
enter multiple keywords separated by space.

Upon pressing enter, the extension will select the first match and switch to
that tab, so one need not type press down if the first match is desired.

For mac use hotkey "Command + L" to focus the Omnibox. Followed by "x<tab>" for fastest access.
